# Microsoft-Power-BI-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project
Purpose:
Tailwind Traders requires a detailed report that outlines the company’s latest sales data. The report must contain gross amounts and the difference between gross and net sales. Let’s help Tailwind Traders create this report so it can shape its future sales strategies.

Data Source: 
Tailwind Traders Sales.xlsx
Purchases.xlsx
Countries.xlsx
Exchange Data(Integrated using Python)
Sales in USD(Created using DAX)
Calendar Table(Created using DAX)



Task Summary:
I designed and implemented an end-to-end Power BI solution that transformed multi-source sales and exchange rate data into a structured, USD-based reporting model. The dashboard enables interactive exploration of sales, profit margins, and time-based performance metrics through optimized visuals and DAX-driven calculations.

Work Performed:
I prepared and validated transactional sales data in Excel, calculating gross revenue, total tax, and net revenue to ensure data accuracy before integration. In Power BI, I performed data transformation and cleansing using Power Query, enforced correct data types, filtered return records, and integrated historical exchange rate data through Python scripting.

I designed a structured data model with defined relationships, including a dedicated calendar table and a DAX-calculated USD conversion table. I developed advanced DAX measures for yearly profit margin, quarterly profit (QTD), year-to-date (YTD) profit, and median sales to support time-intelligence analysis. I optimized performance using Performance Analyzer and built interactive Sales and Profit dashboards using bar, column, line, area, pie charts, KPIs, slicers, and drill-through functionality to deliver clear financial insights.
